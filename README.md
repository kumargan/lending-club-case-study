## General Information

### Project Information

> Lending club data set to statistically analyse based on past data, whether a loan will be defaulted.

### Project Background

> This company is the largest **online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures**. 
> Like most other lending companies, lending loans to **‘risky’** applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). 
> **Credit loss** is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. 
> In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. 
> In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

### Project Statement

> Find the driving factors which indicate default in loans.
### Data Set

> The data set is a csv file with the loan data for the Lending Club.
